## Joshua Allen Holm, MLIS, MEd

### About Joshua

Hi, I'm Joshua. I'm passionate about open source, open access, and open educational resources. I have a strong interest in Linux and technology and how they can be used to improve education. I believe that by making knowledge freely available, we can make the world a better place. I'm always looking for new ways to share information and create more accessible learning opportunities for everyone.
